I will create a Python application which will pop-up a window in which the user will be requested to browse for an excel file within
his personal computer. 

The application will then display in a more elevated manner the information which is in the excel file.

Main information that should be displayed:
- The columns which the excel has
- The data type under each column
- Number of columns
- Number of rows under each column.
- Ability to search for any keyword and the app will give you the coordinates for it within the excel file

If we close the application, the user will be prompted with "Are you sure you want to close?"

App will be polished as soon as I get more ideas.
